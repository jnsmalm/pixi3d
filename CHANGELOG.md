## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- The default value for `alphaMode` on `StandardMaterial` was changed to `blend` to make it easier to render transparent objects without having to change `alphaMode`. To get the previous behavior, set `alphaMode` to `opaque`.

## [1.5.1] - 2022-07-26
### Fixed
- Removed peer dependencies from `package.json` which caused issues with multiple PixiJS versions when using bundlers.

## [1.5.0] - 2022-07-23
### Added
- Added `Mesh3D.createSphere` function for creating a sphere mesh.
- Added support for vertex colors.
- Added `Material.from` function to be able to create a custom material without the need of extending from `Material`.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue which caused picking interaction to not function correctly when resolution was any other value than 1.
- Fixed an issue which caused `Skybox` to not render correctly when using PixiJS v6+.
- Fixed sorting of meshes when using values less than 0.
- Fixed warning when using `PostProcessingSprite` with PixiJS v6+.

- Skybox will now be rendered before other meshes by default.

### Changed
- Vertex skinning now uses textures for joint matrices as default.
- Better error handling when vertex skinning is not supported on device/environment.
- Use lower case for `SpriteBillboardType` "spherical" and "cylindrical".

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue which caused shadows to be displayed incorrectly when using multiple lights.
- Fixed an issue which caused a crash if application/renderer was destroyed.

## [0.9.9] - 2021-09-30
### Added
- Added `Sprite3D` which works like regular PixiJS 2D sprites but in 3D space.
- Improved support for glTF.
- Added `fromHex` function to `Color`.
- Added `TextureTransform` which can used to offset, scale and rotate texture coordinates.
- Added `min` and `max` values for mesh geometry attributes to be able to create bounds for a mesh.
- Meshes rendered using `StandardPipeline` is now sorted by `renderSortOrder`.

### Changed
- Removed `setFromMultiply` from `TransformMatrix`, use `multiply` function instead.
- Removed `factory` from `StandardMaterial`, use `create` function instead.
- Removed `addRenderPass` and `removeRenderPass` from `StandardPipeline`, use `renderPasses` array instead.
- `Joint` now extends `Container3D`.
- Removed ambient lights, use `ImageBasedLighting` with `Cubemap.fromColor` instead.
- Renamed `TransformMatrix` to `Matrix4`.
- Renamed `morphWeights` to `targetWeights` on `Mesh3D`.
- Setting `renderSortType` on `Material` no longer changes `depthMask`.
- Default exposure for `StandardMaterial` was changed from 3 to 1.
- Changed `enabledRenderPasses` on `Mesh3D` to an object instead of an array.
- Changed the constructor for `ShadowCastingLight` to use an options object. Arguments `softness` and `shadowArea` was added as properties instead.

### Fixed
- Fixed issues which caused `Camera`, `PostProcessingSprite` and `PickingHitArea` to not work correctly when renderer resolution was more than 1.
- Fixed an issue which caused `screenToRay` on `Camera` to return incorrect results when `orthographic = true`.

## [0.9.8] - 2021-08-23
### Added
- Added `scale` function to `Mat4`.

### Changed
- Setting `alphaMode` on `StandardMaterial` no longer changes `depthMask` or `renderSortType`.
- Setting `renderSortType` on `Material` also changes `depthMask`.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue which caused a crash when application was destroyed.

## [0.9.7] - 2021-08-11
### Added
- New functionality to `PostProcessingSprite` so it can be used for rendering a 3D object as a 2D sprite.
- Added `translate` function to `Mat4`.
- Added `lookAt` function to `Transform3D` to make it easier for an object to be rotated towards a specified point.

## [0.9.6] - 2021-07-28
### Added
- Added `destroy` function to an instanced model.
- Added functionality to create a `Color` object from bytes.

- Turn off writing to depth buffer when rendering transparent objects using `StandardMaterial`. This feature if only available in PixiJS 6.0+.
- `Color` default alpha has been changed to 1 instead of 0.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue which caused mesh instances to be rendered even if they were `visible = false`.
- Fixed an issue which caused `StandardMaterial` not to render double sided materials correctly.
- Using `StandardMaterial` alpha mode "mask" previously rendered the object as transparent, this should no longer be the case.
